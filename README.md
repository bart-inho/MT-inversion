# MT-inversion
Due to solar radiation as well as other natural phenomena, the geomagnetic field shows daily natural variations. These variations are used as a source of electromagnetic induction in the Earth’s crust. The MT method is a passive geological exploration technique based on simultaneous measurements of electric and magnetic field variations at the Earth's surface. Tikhonov (1950) and Cagniard (1953) discovered that complex ratios, named impedances, describing the penetration of electromagnetic fields within the Earth, can be computed from these measurements. These impedances are then used to study the resistivity / conductivity structure of the Earth’s crust in depth. The main objective of this project to study a set of MT data recorded in 1995 over peninsula on the west coast of Greenland, under a 1D electrical conductivity distribution assumption. To start, MT literature will be given to you, and you will have the opportunity learn about the MT method. The next step will then be to create synthetic 1D MT data and work with them using a MATLAB forward modeling function. After that, you will study real MT data. Based on your reading, you will study the dimensionality of the data provided and determine whether a 1D assumption is reasonable. Then you will contribute to writing a 1D inversion code in order to estimate the electrical conductivity distribution from MT measurements.
